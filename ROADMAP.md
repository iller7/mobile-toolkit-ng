# Angular Mobile Roadmap

This is a rough view of the roadmap for Angular Mobile Toolkit.
Angular Mobile Toolkit is an unusual project, in that its tools
span several projects, implementations, and partners.
It's better to consider Angular Mobile as an initiative to help drive
the state of the art of mobile development with Angular 2, with
some of its own first-class tools.

This roadmap is primarily concerned with the tools under the
Angular Mobile Toolkit, with some information about corresponding
efforts in other projects like Universal, Angular Core, Ionic, NgRx,
AngularFire etc.

## Stages

Our roadmap is composed of milestones that are focused on some cohesive goal,
with a list of deliverables for each milestone. For the active milestone,
each deliverable includes a label indicating its current stage of development.

Here are what the stages mean:

 * **Stage 0:** Not started
 * **Stage 1:** Design has consensus
 * **Stage 2:** Started
 * **Stage 3:** Feature implemented and published. Ideally integrated with Angular CLI.
 * **Stage 4:** Good e2e+unit test coverage. Feature has been dogfooded by one developer not on the Angular Mobile team. Feature is testable and debuggable by developer users.
 * **Stage 5:** Released to npm or equivalent. Well-documented on mobile.angular.io or equivalent. Verified/accepted by one stakeholder in the feature as adequately solving a real problem.
 * **Stage 6:** Used in production in a real, non-demo app.

A milestone can be considered complete when all of its deliverables are at at least stage 5.
